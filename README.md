`m4` is one of those annoying dependencies that is used in build systems. It's also an arbitrary macro language, but that's not used as often nowadays.

Anyway, this ports it from FreeBSD to Windows.

Specifically this adds them to all targets, tested on:

- **Windows**

  - [coming soon] MSVC 2022* (tested on x86 and x64)
  - [coming soon] MinGW (tested on x86 and x64)
  - Cygwin

*should support all versions down to ~2010 also
